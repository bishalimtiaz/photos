This project is developed with the Flutter Version: 3.19.3 

Limitations and Improvement Scope:
    - This app won't show cloud albums or photos. It will only show photos from device.
    - Permission Deny wasn't handled due to time shortage. As a improvement we can show dialogue and redirect to settings if user deny photo permission.
    - Tests for some of the modules or classes is not provided due to time shortage.
    - Also there is open issue in flutter that we might experience: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/124382
